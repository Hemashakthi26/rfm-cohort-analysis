# RFM & Cohort Analysis

## Project Overview
-This project performs **Cohort Analysis** and **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis** on retail transaction data to understand customer retention and purchasing behavior.
-Cohort analysis helps identify customer retention trends over time, while RFM analysis segments customers based on how recently, how frequently, and how much they purchase.
-This project was completed as part of the **GUVI Data Science Course**.

## Dataset
